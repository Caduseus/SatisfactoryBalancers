This collection includes following INPUTxOUTPUT belt balancers (Width, Height, Length in Splitters):
- 3x3    (W1, H3, L3)
- 6x6    (W1, H6, L4)
- 9x9    (W1, H9, L4)
- 12x12  (W2, H6, L6)
- 18x18  (W2, H9, L6)
- 27x27  (W3, H9, L6)
- 36x36  (W4, H9, L8)
- 54x54  (W6, H9, L8)

Everything is made in vanilla Satisfactory without any mods or 3rd party tools. All inputs lead equally to all outputs, so every setup is perfectly balanced, as all things should be.

Yellow is input side, green is output side. Middle parts use whatever color you have in the customizer color "FICSIT Factory Swatch".

There is also an Extender for 54x54 balancer, if you wish to make a 108x108 setup. Here is how it works:
1. Set two 54x54 Balancers side by side.
2. Set two 54x54 Extenders directly in front of them.
3. Hook the right Balancer's outputs to orange ports in both Extenders.
4. Hook the left Balancer's outputs to turquoise ports in both Extenders.
5. Green ports become the 108x108 Balancer outputs.
