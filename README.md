Satisfactory Belt Balancer Collection


This collection includes following INPUTxOUTPUT belt balancers:
3x3
6x6
9x9
12x12
18x18
27x27
36x36
54x54

Every setup is perfectly balanced, as all things should be. All inputs lead equally to all outputs.

Yellow is input side, green is output side. Middle parts use whatever color you have in the customizer color "FICSIT Factory Swatch".

There is also an Extender for 54x54 balancer, if you wish to make a 108x108 setup. Here is how it works:
1. Set two 54x54 Balancers side by side.
2. Set two 54x54 Extenders directly in front of them.
3. Hook the right Balancer's outputs to orange ports in both Extenders.
4. Hook the left Balancer's outputs to turquoise ports in both Extenders.
5. Green ports become the 108x108 Balancer outputs.

You could even keep on chaining Balancers for ever larger setups. To make a 216x216 balancer you need four more Extenders in front of two 108 Balancers, hooking right 108 Balancer's ports to all four Extenders' yellow ports and left 108 Balancer's ports to all torquoise ports.
